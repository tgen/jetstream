# Jetstream v1.7.4 Release Notes

## Major changes
- Improved pipeline version parsing to use PEP440 style versioning - `development` and `latest` have been added as aliases to the latest development and stable release respectively.
  - Pipelines and their version now have a defined comparison format, e.g. defining `__lt__` and `__eq__` functions, this allows for a sorted pipeline list.
- Improved handling support of JS_PIPELINE_PATH both within template via the `expand_vars` function and within the slurm_singularity backend.

## Bug fixes
- The slurm_singularity backend has improved search functionality for finding cached images, previously only found cached images if the digest was explicitly defined for the task.
- Avoid erroneously attempting to bind $JS_PIPELINE_PATH if it has not been set, e.g. if the user is simply running `jetstream run` without any pipeline context.

## Minor changes
- Linting related adjustments to the slurm_singularity.py backend
- Limiting the networkx version range to exclude the 3.0 release for now
