# Jetstream

Jetstream is a pipeline development framework written as a pure Python package 
and command-line utility. It supports complex workflows modeled as directed-
acyclic graphs (DAGs), and execution on batch schedulers (Slurm).

# Getting Started

Jetstream can be installed with Pip:

```shell
pip3 install git+https://github.com/tgen/jetstream.git@master
```

After installing with Pip, the command line utility can be launched with
`jetstream`, and help can be accessed with the `-h/--help` options. If 
the command is not found, see the detailed [installation](#installation) 
help below. There are two ways to work with Jetstream: 1) via the 
command-line utility or 2) as a Python package. The majority of this guide 
will cover the command-line interface which is the most common use case. 

```shell
$ jetstream -h
```


## Build

The building blocks of a Jetstream pipeline are [templates](docs/templates.md). 
Templates are scripts that describe the steps required for a pipeline. Some
pipelines can be a single template file. Other pipelines will require several 
template and supporting data files. 

Templates describe a set of reusable _tasks_ that can be run for multiple sets 
of input data. You can think of templates like a declarative scripting language 
for building pipelines. 

Here is an example template file:

```
- name: hello_world
  cmd: echo "{{ greeting }} world"
  
```

Complex pipelines can be designed with modular templates and organized into
packages. Packaged pipelines can also include supporting data, documentation, 
etc. that can be referenced in the template files. See 
[pipelines](docs/pipelines.md) for details.


## Run

Jetstream encourages project-oriented workflows. With this pattern, work is 
divided into separate directories (projects), and pipelines are executed on
specific projects. Projects are directories where a pipeline run will execute
and output files will be saved. Using projects makes it easier to organize logs
and run metadata. It also allows for incremental changes in a pipeline to be
applied without re-running the entire workflow.

Projects can be created with the `init` command:

```
$ jetstream init <path to project>
```

Now, [templates](docs/templates.md) can be run with the `run` command:

```
$ jetstream run example.jst -c greeting hola
```

[Pipelines](docs/pipelines.md) can be run by name with the `pipelines` command:

```
$ jetstream pipelines foo_pipe
```

## Inspect

Jetstream can track data about pipeline runs in order to:

- Resume runs that fail or need to be paused
- Investigate problems that occur when running the pipeline
- Gather run and task data for secondary analysis

The following commands can be used for inspecting Jetstream projects:

- `jetstream project` for viewing project summary or details

- `jetstream tasks` for viewing summary or details for specific tasks

- `jetstream pipelines` can be used to inspect pipeline details

# Vignette

This section will walk through a typical use case that demonstrates the basics
of creating and running a pipeline on projects. As a basic introduction, we'll
create and run a pipeline that performs somatic variant calling on genome
sequencing data. Jetstream template files are the building blocks for pipelines.
They are simple text documents that containin a set of _tasks_ to run. It may
help to think of templates like scripts that Jetstream can interpret and
execute. 

* To get started, copy the following code to a new file. We'll dive into the 
details later, for now, just save it to a new file called `somatic_caller.jst`

<details>
<summary>Click here to see the code</summary>

```yaml
# Simple template for calling somatic variants from fastqs for matched 
# tumor/normal pairs
{% set tumor_bam %}{{ tumor.name }}.bam{% endset %}
{% set normal_bam %}{{ normal.nam }}.bam{% endset %}
{% set tumor_rg %}@RG\\tID:{{ tumor.name }}\\tSM:{{ tumor.name }}{% endset %}
{% set normal_rg %}@RG\\tID:{{ normal.name }}\\tSM:{{ normal.name }}{% endset %}

- name: align_tumor
  cmd: |
     set -ue

     # Align fastqs with bwa, sort with samtools
     bwa mem \
       -t {{ threads }} \
       -R "{{ tumor_rg }}" \
       "{{ bwa_index }}" \
       "{{ tumor.r1fq }}" \
       "{{ tumor.r2fq }}" |\
       samtools sort \
         -O BAM \
         -@ {{ threads }} \
         - \
         -o "{{ tumor.name }}.bam"

      # Generate an index with samtools
      samtools index \
        -@ {{ threads }} \
        "{{ tumor.name }}.bam"


- name: align_normal
  cmd: |
     set -ue

     # Align fastqs with bwa, sort with samtools
     bwa mem \
       -t {{ threads }} \
       -R "{{ normal_rg }}" \
       "{{ bwa_index }}" \
       "{{ normal.r1fq }}" \
       "{{ normal.r2fq }}" |\
       samtools sort \
         -O BAM \
         -@ {{ threads }} \
         - \
         -o "{{ normal.name }}.bam"

      # Generate an index with samtools
      samtools index \
        -@ {{ threads }} \
        "{{ normal.name }}.bam"


- name: call_somatic_variants
  cmd: | 
    set -ue

    gatk Mutect2 \
      --reference "{{ reference_fasta }}" \
      --input "{{ tumor_bam }}" \
      --input "{{ normal_bam }}" \
      --tumor-sample "{{ tumor.name }}" \
      --normal-sample "{{ normal.name }}" \
      --output "{{ vcf_path }}"

```
</details>

* In order to run the template, we'll need to provide values to fill in 
the variables. For this example, were going to add all of the input data
to a single config file in YAML format. Save the code below to a new file
called `inputs.yaml`.

<details>
<summary>Click here to see the code</summary>

TODO: These values should be filled in with `${JETSTREAM_TUTORIAL}/<filename>..` 
but first we need to create a tutorial dataset and upload to some public place

```yaml
tumor:
    name: 
    r1fq:
    r2fq:
normal:
    name:
    r1fq:
    r2fq:
bwa_index:
reference_fasta:
```
</details>

* Now that we have a template and an input config file we can run the
pipeline. In order for Jetstream to save progress and run logs, we need to
create a new project directory. When running pipelines inside of a jetstream
project directory logs will be organized, and progress data will allow you to
pause/restart/resume runs. Use the following command to initialize a new
project:

```shell
jetstream init js_somatic_tutorial
```

* Before running the pipeline, we'll verify that the template and config data
are valid with the render feature. This option will fill in all of the
variables in the template with data from our config file, and show us the
final commands that  will be executed when the pipeline runs. Use the
following command to render the template (notice the `-C` is a capital c):

```shell
jetstream render somatic_caller.jst -C inputs.yaml
```

* You should have received an error that there was no value provided for the 
variable `threads`. This was intentionally omitted from our config file to 
demonstrate some of the options for providing config data. Several values can
be given with a config file using `-C/--config-file` options, or single config
values can be given with the `-c/--config` options. Since we don't know what
kind of  computer you're using to run this pipeline, so we'll let you decide
the number of threads to use. Here's how you would supply that value via the
command line,  replace 4 with the number of processor cores you would like to
use:

```shell
jetstream render somatic_caller.jst -C inputs.yaml -c int:threads 4
```

* Now the template should render successfully and be printed to the console.
If everything looks good, we're ready to run. Use the following command to 
execute the pipeline.

```shell
jetstream run somatic_caller.jst -C inputs.yaml -c int:threads 4 --project js_somatic_tutorial
```

* The runner will start executing commands in the order descibed by the task
dependencies. If any tasks fail, you'll see messages in the logs, and the 
runner will exit with a non-zero status. If all tasks complete successfully
the runner will exit with a zero.

* Since we used a project, all outputs will be saved in that directory. 
After the runner completes, we can `cd js_somatic_tutorial` and see the results.

* Inside the directory you should see the output data files, along with a 
`jetstream` index directory that contains data generated by the runner. There
are  several subcommands that can be used to inspect projects and get
information about the tasks that were executed. Try the following commands:

```
# See details about the project and current status
jetstream project
# See a brief summary for all tasks 
jetstream tasks
# See detailed information for all tasks
jetstream tasks -v
```

* Thank you for following along.

# Installation

> TGen users on Gemini should use `module load python37` as this already has
many dependencies preinstalled and is currently used in production. Additional
installation help can be found in this [`presentation`][presentation]

This is a Python package and requires Python3 (>=3.7). Installation guides for 
Mac/Windows/Linux are available from the [Hitchiker's Guide to Python][install_help].
After Python3 is installed, you can install Jetstream with Pip (next step).

## Install with Pip

_It is recommended to install a specific release tag_:
```shell
pip3 install git+https://github.com/tgen/jetstream.git@v1.7.4
```

Optionally, jetstream can be installed via a branch name:
```shell
pip3 install git+https://github.com/tgen/jetstream.git@master
```

For most users in an HPC environment, installing to /usr/bin will not be possible
due to permissions. In this case we will need to add `--user` to the pip3 command:
```shell
pip3 install --user git+https://github.com/tgen/jetstream.git@v1.7.4
```

## Troubleshooting: Command not found after install

Pip installs package scripts and executables automatically. In some
cases you will need to update your [`PATH`][PATH] to include the directory 
where these scripts are stored.

- **MacOS**:

    Changes should be added to ``~/.bash_profile``.

    Installed system-wide: the bin directory will be ``/usr/local/bin/``

    Installed with ``--user``: the bin directory will be
    ``~/Library/Python/<pythonversion>/bin``

- **Linux**:

    Changes should be added to ``~/.bashrc``

    Installed system wide: the bin directory will be ``/usr/bin/``

    Installed with ``--user``: the bin directory will be ``~/.local/bin/``

[`See this post`][path_help] for more information.
